      <p class="text-size"><u>Report Summary: Technical Approach</u>
      </p>
      <p class="text-size">We are basing our final project on top of Project 4. We have started
        implementing OpenMP to
        speed up the simulation time. We began by refactoring some of the common processes/math operations inside the
        for
        loops, and by putting them outside the loop. Then, we used OpenMP pragma to parallelize almost all the for loops
        that we used for the simulation. To successfully use OpenMP, we added a flag for OpenMP in CMakeList.txt. Then
        we
        implemented our own timer to allow us to quantify the speedup. We also modified the code to be able to specify
        the
        number of frames with -t tag in the command line. Using OpenMP, we saw that the simulation time improved by
        approximately a factor of 3. We consider this significant progress on speeding up the simulation time. </p>

      <p class="text-size">Aside from that, we began implementing different type of clothes. In all
        three types of clothing, we increased the weight of each item 10 times to make the weight of the clothing
        heavier
        so that its behavior is closer to the real fabric.
      </p>

      <p class="text-size">In the first type of cloth, we change to half the maximum length of the bending spring for
        every 6-point mass in height and width directions. In contrast, we double this parameter for one spring between
        each pair of them because the cloth will not be tight a lot. Also, for these longer bending springs, we decrease
        the spring coefficient more than usual because we need them to be looser in the cloth. As a result, the cloth
        will
        be bumpy in some small square areas, and it always keeps its form in different conditions.</p>
      <p class="text-size">In the second type of cloth, we change to 0.7 the maximum length of the bending spring for
        every 6-point mass in horizontal directions. It causes the cloth to have some wrinkles in the vertical
        direction.
        It is like a cloth that we have folded and ironed. To prevent the fabric from shrinking too much, we tripled the
        maximum length of the structural-type spring in some places horizontally and made the spring coefficient 10
        times
        weaker. In this type, we manipulate both structural and bending spring types.</p>
      <p class="text-size">The third type of cloth is fancier. It is wavy in horizontal, but it is straight or changes
        the
        wave direction when more mass falls on it. We reach this type with a trick. First, we find each bending spring
        that has a sixth position in vertical and horizontal. Then, if it is a vertical spring, we decrease its max
        length
        to 0.8 of the default. ​It causes the cloth to be wavy but not forced in all places.</p>
      <p class="text-size">We have also implemented uniform wind fields. Our implementation was motivated by the general
        techniques described in a 1991 SIGGRAPH paper by Wejchert and Haumann titled “<a
          href="https://people.cs.clemson.edu/~dhouse/courses/817/papers/wejcherthaumann91.pdf">Animation
          Aerodynamics</a>”. To
        approximate the interaction with a uniform wind field and our cloth, we used <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stokes%27_law">Stoke’s Law</a>: <img src="images/stroke.png" height="20px"
          width="70px">
        which states that the drag force Fd acting opposite to a particle moving through a fluid with a <a
          href="https://www.engineersedge.com/physics/viscosity_of_air_dynamic_and_kinematic_14483.htm#:~:text=The%20viscosity%20of%20air%20depends,10%2D5%20Pa%C2%B7s%20.">dynamic
          viscosity</a> <i>mu</i> is proportional to the radius R of the particle and the velocity v of the liquid
        relative to the
        particle. The only modifications to this formula was to use the surface area of the cloth instead of radius and
        to scale the drag force by the absolute value of the dot product between the pointMass normal and the wind
        vector. We take the absolute value of the dot product because the force from the wind should act in the same
        direction regardless of the orientation of the cloth face. There are still some things left to improve in our
        implementation of wind such as checking for objects in front of the cloth and setting the surface area of the
        boundary masses to be lower than the other masses. Also, we implemented an option to view the wind field
        visually as a vector field in the simulation to make it easier to see the interaction between the cloth and
        different wind speeds and directions.</p>
      <p class="text-size"> Here is our updated work plan:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Implementing more precise self-collision and collision with an object</li>
        <li>More optimization for cloth simulation</li>
        <li>Finalize wind simulation/li>
        <li>Finalize simulation of new types of cloths</li>
        <li>If time permits, implementing more speed-up using more threads with GPU</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- <h2 align="middle"><strong><u>Project Summary</u></strong></h2>
<p class="text-size">Fabric behaves like both a solid and liquid, and simulation of fabric
  involves controlling the interaction between these two types of
  materials. We intend to simulate different fabric models by changing and
  adding parameters to the fabric. Also, we want to investigate the
  interaction of cloth with various materials such as solids, liquids, and
  gases.</p>
  <br>
<h2 align="middle"><strong><u>Problem Description</u></strong></h2>
<p class="text-size">There are many different types of fabrics today.  Some are thin, some are thick. Some of them stretch only in one direction, and some do not have the same weight in all points. Some fabrics do not even smooth out with ironing and are always wrinkled. All of these features are challenging to simulate because they require additional definitions and implementations in the simulation. Also, we tend to simulate fabric interaction with different materials, either physical, such as spheres, and abstract, such as wind. We know the interaction of this type of fabric with other materials is very challenging and thought-provoking. We think that we can simulate clothing by adding different members to the clothing class and implementing some helper functions to change these variables.</p>
<br>
<h2 align="middle"><strong><u>Goals and Deliverables</u></strong></h2>
<p class="text-size">We want to create a more comprehensive class of clothing that can be changed from one type to another by changing its parameters. Changing the characteristics of a garment, in addition to making it look different, makes it interact with other materials and objects differently. We want this simulation to be very real. ​For example, the collision of a sphere with the fabric causes the fabric to stretch. If the fabric is wrinkled, it should return to its original state after it is released. ​In the simulation, the fabric is defined as a simple mesh with different connections. We think working on this simple mesh has a lot of ambition for us. Because of the simplicity of the fabric structure we learned in this class, we have more mastery of change and debugging. ​It is like an empty canvas that we can paint as we wish, and we try and research in some corners and its implementation.</p>
<br>
<h2 align="middle"><u>Planned Demonstration</u></h2>
<p class="text-size">We intend to provide a demo of the effect of collisions between cloth and other objects to show the unique properties of different clothes. With this demo, the effect of the laws of physics on the structure of different fabrics can be seen.<br/><br/>To measure the result of the work, it is necessary to see the details and changes in the fabric in different modes. The more realistic our simulation is, the better the quality of our simulation. So, for the most part, we will be assessing the rendering subjectively.<br/><br/>Can all fabric simulations with mesh and springing simulate different types of cloth or should we change the structure of the cloth class for some fabrics?</p>
